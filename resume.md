# Summary

> I’m a full stack web developer who can build apps from the ground up. I've worked mostly at startups so I am use to wearing many hats. I am a very product focussed developer who priotizes user feedback first and foremost. I'm generally very flexible when investigating new roles. 

# Work Experience (only last 10 years)

## Cdnjs 

**Co-Founder** (Sept 2014 - Jan 2016)

Following Google’s CDN for jQuery, we decided to start a CDN for the less popular Javascript frameworks. The CDN is community moderated and open source on GitHub. We secured a partnership with Cloudflare who now supports the infrastructure.

- **Millions** of sites use the CDN in production.
- **Thousands** of developers contribute to the project.
- **Hundreds** of pull requests have been merged.
- **Dozens** of companies use the CDN in production.
